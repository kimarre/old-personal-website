          <h3>Makeup!</h3>

          <p>My favorite method of destressing from the worries of school and life is escaping to a few hours of creative makeup fun.</p>

          <p>The two looks on the right are the more dramatic looks I've done. The Bane mask is probably my favorite because I made it from scratch based off a picture from The Dark Knight Rises movie. It was done in a combination of makeup and facepaint and took about 3-4 hours to finish.</p>

          <img class="aboutMeImage" src="aboutMePics/cats.jpg" width="350" align="left">
          <br><p>After moving into a house that allowed cats, in the past couple years I have adopted two. They're my babycats (even if they're not considered kittens anymore) and I love them to death. </p>

          <p>My grey tabby, Moose, was my first babycat. After a long search at many shelters, I found and adopted him from the animal shelter in Bakersfield.</p>

          <p>Charlie is my other babycat. He's the one that looks like grumpy cat. Charlie is a seal bicolor ragdoll, and is the sweetest, most cuddly cat ever. Already larger than Moose, but still technically a kitten, he's the most dog-like cat I've ever met.</p>

          <h3>Band!</h3>
          <img class="aboutMeImage" src="aboutMePics/marching.jpg" width="450" align="left">
          </br><p>I've been in band since 5th grade. My first and main instrument is clarinet. I was first chair and section leader for two years in high school. </p>
          
          <p>However, I really like to dabble in all aspects of the band. Just at Cal Poly, I've done two years on cymbals, one quarter on clarinet, and a year in the color guard. Along the way, I picked up some basic skills on bass drum, but have only played it for one or two basketball games.</p>

          <p>I've really enjoyed the well rounded experience I've gotten in Cal Poly's band from section-hopping. Each section has had something different and awesome to offer me. </p>
